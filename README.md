# Middleware
   # Authentication and Authorization:
   # Middleware can handle user authentication, checking if a user is logged in, and verifying their permissions for accessing certain resources.

   # Logging:
   # Middleware is often used for logging requests, responses, and other relevant information for debugging and monitoring purposes.

   # Error Handling:
   # Middleware can catch errors globally, allowing you to handle them in a centralized way rather than duplicating error-handling logic in each route or component.
